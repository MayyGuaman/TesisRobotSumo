%\section*{ABSTRACT}

\noindent
Security log management and auditing constitutes a critical challenge in modern cybersecurity, especially in organizations handling sensitive information requiring strict regulatory compliance, where traditional systems present fundamental vulnerabilities in terms of integrity, immutability, and traceability that significantly limit the capability to detect, investigate, and effectively respond to security incidents. This research develops and implements an innovative solution based on blockchain technology using Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned platform to guarantee secure, immutable, and verifiable security log management through a multi-organization architecture comprising two specialized entities: LogProvider, responsible for generation, filtering, and storage of logs via UDP protocols and rsyslog, and LogAuditor, in charge of cryptographic verification and auditing of historical records. The system integrates X.509 digital certificates, CouchDB databases for persistence, smart contracts developed in Node.js that define business rules for recording, querying, and auditing security events, incorporating advanced authentication mechanisms through SHA-256 digital signatures, MD5 hash-based duplicate elimination, and enriched metadata including precise timestamps, unique identifiers, and security context. The successful implementation demonstrates the technical viability of the proposed solution, confirming that permissioned blockchain technology can guarantee immutability and authenticity of security logs through robust cryptographic mechanisms, eliminating single points of failure present in traditional centralized systems and providing a distributed environment resistant to malicious manipulations and unauthorized alterations. The developed solution presents horizontal scalability characteristics, interoperability with existing infrastructures, and adaptability to diverse organizational environments, contributing to the cybersecurity field through a practical and replicable framework that establishes a new paradigm for reliable security log management in critical enterprise environments.
